# Resource Repository App

----
###Summary###
>This web app allows teachers to share links to helpful websites for their students. When signing up, choose if you are a teacher or student. Teachers have the ability to create a resource link and assign it tags. Students and teachers can then search for these tags, and a filtered list of resources will be displayed. Additionally, if a teacher adds the tag 'teacher only', this repository will only be visible to teachers (both in searches and in the browse section).

*WIP -- users can favorite resources, and these resources will be pushed to the top of the list in searches*
